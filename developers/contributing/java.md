A page with a more detailed description of the LOCKSS Program's preferred Java style is under construction, but a brief summary is:

*   LOCKSS software written in Java must be compatible with Java 8. *The classic LOCKSS daemon (version 1.x) must be compatible with Java 7.*
*   No tab characters should be present, only spaces (but extant tab characters should be displayed as 8 space characters)
*   Indentation is 2 space characters
*   Mandatory Egyptian-style curly braces
