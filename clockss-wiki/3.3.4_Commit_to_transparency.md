## 3.3.4 - The repository shall commit to transparency and accountability in all actions supporting the operation and management of the repository that affect the preservation of digital content over time.

There are two aspects of transparency and accountability:

  - *Financial* - As a 501(c)(3) organization, the CLOCKSS Archive is
    required by the Internal Revenue Service to make public its annual
    financial reports, which are available on the Web [from
    GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/organizations/26-3098051/digital-distributed-community-archive.aspx).
  - *Technical* - the regular external reports to the Keepers Registry
    and elsewhere detailing the operation of the CLOCKSS Archive are
    described in [CLOCKSS: Logging and
    Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#External_reports "wikilink").
    The LOCKSS team has a long history of [publishing technical
    papers](http://www.lockss.org/news-media/publications/), and
    [presenting public talks](http://www.lockss.org/news-media/talks/),
    describing its technology and operations.

The non-confidential documents presented for the TRAC audit will, at the
end of the audit, be made public and maintained current.
