## 5.1.2 - The repository shall manage the number and location of copies of all digital objects.

The CLOCKSS PLN currently consists of 12 CLOCKSS boxes. The network is
configured, as described in [CLOCKSS: Box
Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#CLOCKSS_PLN_Configuration "wikilink"),
to have each CLOCKSS box ingest from the [CLOCKSS: Ingest
Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink") and preserve a complete
copy of everything the publishers have submitted. The [LOCKSS: Polling
and Repair Protocol](LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol "wikilink") and
the monitoring processes described in [CLOCKSS: Logging and
Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records "wikilink") maintain this
condition.
