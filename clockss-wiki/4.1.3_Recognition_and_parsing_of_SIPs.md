## 4.1.3 - The repository shall have adequate specifications enabling recognition and parsing of the SIPs.

[Definition of
SIP](Definition_of_SIP#CLOCKSS_Submission_Information_Package_\(SIP\) "wikilink")
describes the structure and content of the two types of SIP in use by
the CLOCKSS archive. [Definition of
AIP](Definition_of_SIP#Creating_AIPs_from_SIPs "wikilink") describes the
process of parsing these two types of SIP into the single type of AIP in
use by the CLOCKSS archive, an Archival Unit (AU). It describes the role
the publisher *plugin*, a customized instance of a Java class that is at
attribute of the AU, plays in this process. In effect, the plugin is an
executable specification of the AU and the SIPs that provide it with
content. The Harvest Plugin Development and Testing section of [CLOCKSS:
Ingest
Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline#Harvest_Plugin_Development_and_Testing "wikilink")
describes the process of creating this specification for a particular
harvest publisher's SIPs, and the File Transfer Plugin Development and
Testing section of [CLOCKSS: Ingest
Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline#File_Transfer_Plugin_Development_and_Testing "wikilink")
does the same for a file transfer publisher.
