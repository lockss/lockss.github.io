## 5.1.1.2 - The repository shall have adequate hardware and software support for backup functionality sufficient for preserving the repository content and tracking repository functions.

The CLOCKSS network [currently consists of 12 CLOCKSS
boxes](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory "wikilink") in the US
(Stanford, Rice, Indiana, Virginia, OCLC) and in Australia, Canada,
Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and Scotland. Each of these boxes is
configured as described in [CLOCKSS: Box
Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink") to contain a complete
copy of all content [successfully
ingested](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink") into the CLOCKSS Archive.
Their contents are continually audited by the [LOCKSS: Polling and
Repair Protocol](LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol "wikilink"). Any
CLOCKSS trigger event or any failure of both of the replicated triggered
content servers could be satisfied by extracting and disseminating
content from any one of these boxes as described in [CLOCKSS: Extracting
Triggered Content](CLOCKSS:_Extracting_Triggered_Content "wikilink").
Thus in this replicated system architecture each box is backed up by all
of the others.
