## 4.1.4 - The repository shall have mechanisms to appropriately verify the identity of the Producer of all materials.

As described in [Definition of
SIP](Definition_of_SIP#CLOCKSS_Submission_Information_Package "wikilink"),
the CLOCKSS archive uses two types of SIP:

  - [Content for a harvest
    SIP](Definition_of_AIP#Creating_an_AIP_from_a_harvest_SIP "wikilink")
    is fetched from the publisher's web site using HTTP, and its URL
    thus includes the publisher's domain name.
  - [Content for a file transfer
    SIP](Definition_of_AIP#Creating_an_AIP_from_a_file_transfer_SIP "wikilink")
    is transferred using a publisher-specific user name and password,
    which identifies the publisher.
