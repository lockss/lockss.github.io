## 5.1.1.1.6 - The repository shall have procedures in place to monitor and receive notifications when software changes are needed.

The process for monitoring the [software stack underlying the LOCKSS
daemon](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory#Software "wikilink")
for needed changes is described in the Software Obsolescence section of
[CLOCKSS: Threats and
Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Software_Obsolescence "wikilink"),
which also describes the risks involved. Further documentation is in the
Dependencies section of [LOCKSS: Software Development
Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process#Dependencies "wikilink")
and in [LOCKSS: Format Migration](LOCKSS:_Format_Migration "wikilink").

The process by which requirements for changes to the LOCKSS daemon are
developed is described in the Requirements section of [LOCKSS: Software
Development
Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process#Requirements "wikilink").
Additional information about requirements for plugin development is in
the same document.
