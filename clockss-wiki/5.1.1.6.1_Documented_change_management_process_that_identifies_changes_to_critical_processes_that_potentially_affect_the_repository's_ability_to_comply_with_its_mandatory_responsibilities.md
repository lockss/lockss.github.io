## 5.1.1.6.1 - The repository shall have a documented change management process that identifies changes to critical processes that potentially affect the repository's ability to comply with its mandatory responsibilities.

The three critical processes for the [CLOCKSS: Mandatory
Responsibilities](CLOCKSS:_Mandatory_Responsibilities "wikilink") are
ingest, preservation and dissemination. These processes are performed by
the LOCKSS daemon software running on CLOCKSS boxes and an ingest
pipeline:

  - The process by which changes to the LOCKSS software are managed is
    documented in [LOCKSS: Software Development
    Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process "wikilink").
  - The process by which changes to the hardware and operations of the
    CLOCKSS boxes are managed is documented in [CLOCKSS: Box
    Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink").
  - The process by which changes to the ingest process are managed is
    documented in [CLOCKSS: Ingest
    Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink").
