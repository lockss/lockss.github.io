## 5.1.1.5 - The repository shall have defined processes for storage media and/or hardware change (e.g., refreshing, migration).

The need for such changes is revealed by the processes described in
[CLOCKSS: Logging and
Monitoring](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#Monitoring "wikilink") and
[CLOCKSS: Box
Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#Monitoring "wikilink"). The process
for accomplishing the needed media or hardware change is described in
the [Hardware
Upgrade](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#Hardware_Upgrade "wikilink") and
[Hardware
Replacement](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#Hardware_Replacement "wikilink")
sections of [CLOCKSS: Box
Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink"). The result is recorded
in the spreadsheet described in [CLOCKSS: Hardware and Software
Inventory](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory "wikilink").
