## 3.3.3 - The repository shall have a documented history of the changes to its operations, procedures, software, and hardware.

The histories of the changes to the various aspects of the CLOCKSS
Archive are preserved as follows:

  - Operations:
      - Technical operations are documented in [CLOCKSS: Box
        Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink").
      - Business operations are documented in submissions to, and
        minutes of, the CLOCKSS board.
  - Procedures:
      - Technical procedures are documented in:
          - [CLOCKSS: Ingest
            Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink")
          - [CLOCKSS: Box
            Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink")
          - [CLOCKSS: Extracting Triggered
            Content](CLOCKSS:_Extracting_Triggered_Content "wikilink")
          - [LOCKSS: Software Development
            Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process "wikilink")
          - [LOCKSS: Property Server
            Operations](LOCKSS:_Property_Server_Operations "wikilink")
      - Business procedures are documented in submissions to, and
        minutes of, the CLOCKSS board, and the history of communications
        with libraries and publishers the procedures result in is
        maintained in the RT ticketing system.
  - The software inventory is maintained as described in [CLOCKSS:
    Hardware and Software
    Inventory](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory "wikilink").
    Source code control of the LOCKSS software, and thus its history, is
    provided by [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lockss/).
    As described in [LOCKSS: Software Development
    Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process#Requirements "wikilink"),
    the process of evolving the software is tracked using the Roundup
    system.
  - The hardware inventory is maintained in [CLOCKSS: Hardware and
    Software
    Inventory](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory "wikilink").
