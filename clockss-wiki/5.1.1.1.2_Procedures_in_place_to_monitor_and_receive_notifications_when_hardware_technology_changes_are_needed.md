## 5.1.1.1.2 - The repository shall have procedures in place to monitor and receive notifications when hardware technology changes are needed.

There are three reasons why machines in the [CLOCKSS: Hardware and
Software
Inventory](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory "wikilink"), such as
ingest machines or CLOCKSS boxes, might need to be replaced:

1.  Hardware failure, which would be revealed by the monitoring
    processes described in [CLOCKSS: Ingest
    Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink") and [CLOCKSS: Box
    Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink"), and resolved as
    described in the Hardware Failure section of [CLOCKSS: Threats and
    Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Hardware_Failure "wikilink")
    and the Hardware Replacement section of [CLOCKSS: Box
    Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#Hardware_Replacement "wikilink").
2.  Resource exhaustion, would be revealed by the monitoring processes
    described in [CLOCKSS: Ingest
    Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline "wikilink") and [CLOCKSS: Box
    Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink"), and resolved as
    described in the Hardware Upgrade section of [CLOCKSS: Box
    Operations](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations#Hardware_Upgrade "wikilink").
3.  Technological obsolescence, which would be evident through the staff
    awareness described in [CLOCKSS: Threats and
    Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Operational_Awareness "wikilink").
