## 3.5.1.4 - The repository shall have policies in place to address liability and challenges to ownership/rights.

The CLOCKSS Archive is a dark archive; no access to the content is
permitted, no ownership of the content passes hands, nor are any rights
save preservation transferred, unless and until the CLOCKSS Board
determines that a trigger event has taken place. The [CLOCKSS: Publisher
Agreement](https://www.clockss.org/clocksswiki/files/CLOCKSS_Participating_Publisher_Agreement.pdf)
specifies the circumstances under which a publisher's content can be
withdrawn from the Archive, and the circumstances and processes under
which the CLOCKSS Board may determine that a trigger event has taken
place.
