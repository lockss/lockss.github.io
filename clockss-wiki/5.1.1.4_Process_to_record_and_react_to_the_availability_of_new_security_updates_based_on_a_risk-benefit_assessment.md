## 5.1.1.4 - The repository shall have a process to record and react to the availability of new security updates based on a risk-benefit assessment.

Each CLOCKSS box's operating system is [maintained current with the
CentOS repositories](CLOCKSS:_Box_Operations "wikilink"). The LOCKSS
team does not believe that it is a better position to decide whether
security fixes to the operating system should be installed than the O/S
support system. Some CLOCKSS boxes update automatically from these
repositories within 24 hours, some require administrator intervention.
This mitigates the risk that an erroneous update from CentOS would
impact all CLOCKSS boxes almost simultaneously.

The process by which security requirements for the the LOCKSS software
are developed and addressed is described in [LOCKSS: Software
Development Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process "wikilink").
Once a security enhancement for the LOCKSS daemon is released, all
CLOCKSS boxes install it automatically within 24 hours.
