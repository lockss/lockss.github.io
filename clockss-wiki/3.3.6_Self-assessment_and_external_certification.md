## 3.3.6 - The repository shall commit to a regular schedule of self-assessment and external certification.

There are two aspects to self-assessment:

  - *Financial* - The [Audit Committee of the CLOCKSS
    Board](CLOCKSS:_Governance_and_Organization#CLOCKSS_Board "wikilink")
    regularly evaluates the finances of the CLOCKSS 501(c)(3). See
    [CLOCKSS: Budget and Planning
    Process](CLOCKSS:_Budget_and_Planning_Process "wikilink").
  - *Technical & Operational* - The LOCKSS team has had, and continues
    to have (see [CLOCKSS: Logging and
    Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#Network_Diagnostics "wikilink"))
    an active program of developing and using data collection and
    analysis tools to characterize the performance of the CLOCKSS PLN
    (and other LOCKSS networks) as part of the program of continuous
    improvement described in [LOCKSS: Software Development
    Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process "wikilink").

There are two aspects to external certification:

  - *Financial*
      - The CLOCKSS Board is considering a proposal for a financial
        audit.
      - The finances of the LOCKSS Program are regularly monitored by
        Stanford University's financial organization.
  - *Technical and Operational* - After this TRAC certification, the
    Board will consider future options for external technical
    certification.
