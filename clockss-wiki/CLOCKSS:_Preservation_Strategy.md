# CLOCKSS: Preservation Strategy

## Philosophy

The CLOCKSS Archive is engaged in a global campaign to preserve digital
academic content. This content is largely accessed from and under
control of content providers (e.g., publishers), and it is no longer
served from or curated within institutional libraries. The risk is that
access could be severed at any time via natural disaster, human error,
corporate failure, etc. and the community needs to provide a mechanism
to ensure continued access to such resources over time. As the defining
mission statement of the CLOCKSS Archive emphasizes, to ensure access to
published scholarly content over time, a community-governed partnership
of publishers and libraries working to achieve a sustainable and
globally distributed archive is essential.

The scope of the academic content is broad. The content pursued must be
Web-published. The [Collection
Development](CLOCKSS:_Collection_Development "wikilink") Policy is the
general guideline and is referenced to assist with selection and
acquisition decisions. The approach is to seek content that is
comprehensive (subscribed and unsubscribed) held by host libraries. The
content is preserved for future instances of the same
academically-oriented readers around the globe for which the content was
originally published (see [CLOCKSS: Designated
Community](CLOCKSS:_Designated_Community "wikilink")). The CLOCKSS
Archive is dark; no access is permitted to the content it holds unless
and until the CLOCKSS Board determines that a trigger event has taken
place. If a trigger event takes place, the relevant content is extracted
from the CLOCKSS Archive and transferred to one or more re-publishing
platforms under a Creative Commons license (see [CLOCKSS: Extracting
Triggered Content](CLOCKSS:_Extracting_Triggered_Content "wikilink")).
The Creative Commons license means that anyone can re-publish the
triggered content; the current re-publishing platforms are run by
Stanford and Edinburgh Universities.

The CLOCKSS Archive represents a long-term commitment and requires a
regular review every three years to check its relevance, the technology
paradigm, and the funding model. The focus of the review is revisiting
the CLOCKSS Archive's strategy for archiving scholarly content given
that the larger publishers are much more engaged than the very many
small publishers. The effort develops ideas regarding the preservation
of small publishing entities, including the rapidly growing Open Access
publications.

## Business Implementation

The Business Goals are developed to project the revenues amounts from
the operational sources: Publisher Annual Fees, Publisher Ingest Fees,
Library Support Fees, and Library Node Annual Fees. These revenues
directly support the technical work provided by the LOCKSS team, the
upgrade and maintenance of the network, and the outreach efforts.

1.  Objective: Partner with as many academic publishers as possible
    1.  Goal: Try to avoid too much duplication, except among the
        largest of publishers.
    2.  Goal: Focus on the up and coming Open Access publisher content,
        which is at most risk of disappearing.
2.  Objective: Development of the Library Supporter base
3.  Objective: Timely ingest of content
    1.  Goal: Continue process improvements to capture more content more
        quickly.
    2.  Goal: Review locations of ingest boxes to determine optimal
        access for international content.
    3.  Goal: Continued improvement of reporting on preserved content
        regardless of source.
4.  Objective: Responsibility
    1.  Goal: The Executive Director in conjunction with the Executive
        Committee will be responsible for updating the Business and
        Technical Implementation sections of this Preservation Strategy.
        The current Review Schedule is set to include:
        1.  Comprehensive revision set initially for every five years.
        2.  Targets revised each year.

Progress against the business aspects of the strategy is reviewed at
each meeting of the CLOCKSS Board, and any necessary changes to the
strategy discussed and approved.

## Technical Implementation

The technical realization of this strategy is to:

  - Ingest content in either harvest or file transfer form, see
    [Definition of SIP](Definition_of_SIP "wikilink").
  - Preserve the content unchanged:
      - against the threats described in [CLOCKSS: Threats and
        Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations "wikilink"),
      - in a geographically distributed, carefully controlled, network,
      - by means of the [LOCKSS: Polling and Repair
        Protocol](LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol "wikilink").
  - Permit no access to the content in the network.
  - When content is triggered, transfer it:
      - by the process described in [CLOCKSS: Extracting Triggered
        Content](CLOCKSS:_Extracting_Triggered_Content "wikilink"):
      - under Creative Commons license,
      - if necessary after format migration (see [LOCKSS: Format
        Migration](LOCKSS:_Format_Migration "wikilink")),
      - to multiple sites willing to make it accessible to the [CLOCKSS:
        Designated Community](CLOCKSS:_Designated_Community "wikilink").

Progress in implementing the [CLOCKSS: Collection
Development](CLOCKSS:_Collection_Development "wikilink") policy using
this technical realization is reported to the CLOCKSS Board regularly
(see the [External Reports section of CLOCKSS: Logging and
Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#External_Reports "wikilink")). The
impact of changes in technology and community practice is under
continuous monitoring by the LOCKSS team (see the [Awareness section of
CLOCKSS: Threats and
Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Awareness "wikilink")).
Current examples of the review process in operation include:

  - Improvements to report generation described in [CLOCKSS: Logging and
    Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#External_Reports "wikilink").
  - Improvements to the process for removing AUs from the ingest boxes
    described in [CLOCKSS: Ingest
    Pipeline](CLOCKSS:_Ingest_Pipeline#Harvest_Process "wikilink").
  - Improvements to the network monitoring and data analysis tools
    described in [CLOCKSS: Logging and
    Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records#Network_Diagnostics "wikilink").
  - Improvements to the [LOCKSS: Polling and Repair
    Protocol](LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol#Enhancements "wikilink").
