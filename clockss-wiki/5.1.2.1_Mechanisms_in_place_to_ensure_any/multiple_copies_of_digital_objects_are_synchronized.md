Subsequent to its ingestion, the [LOCKSS: Polling and Repair
Protocol](LOCKSS:_Polling_and_Repair_Protocol "wikilink") among the
CLOCKSS boxes continuously compares each unit of content at each box
with the same unit at a random sample of the other boxes, detecting and
repairing any missing or damaged content. The polling process is
monitored by LOCKSS team members using internal tools as described in
[CLOCKSS: Logging and Records](CLOCKSS:_Logging_and_Records "wikilink").
