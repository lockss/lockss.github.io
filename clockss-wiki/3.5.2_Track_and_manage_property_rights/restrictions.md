## 3.5.2 - The repository shall track and manage intellectual property rights and restrictions on use of repository content as required by deposit agreement, contract, or license.

The CLOCKSS Archive is a dark archive:

  - It has no intellectual property rights in its content; the only
    right it has is to preserve the content. This applies uniformly to
    all content. See [CLOCKSS: Publisher
    Agreement](https://www.clockss.org/clocksswiki/files/CLOCKSS_Participating_Publisher_Agreement.pdf).
  - No access is permitted to any content in the CLOCKSS Archive, except
    as directed by the CLOCKSS Board in response to a trigger event (see
    [CLOCKSS: Extracting Triggered
    Content](CLOCKSS:_Extracting_Triggered_Content "wikilink")). This
    restriction applies uniformly to all content.

Thus is not necessary to "track and manage intellectual property rights
and restrictions on use of repository content" individually.
