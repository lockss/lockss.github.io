## 5.1.1.1.8 - The repository shall have procedures, commitment and funding to replace software when evaluation indicates the need to do so.

The CLOCKSS archive [uses only free, open source
software](CLOCKSS:_Hardware_and_Software_Inventory#Software "wikilink").
As regards replacing parts of the stack underlying the LOCKSS daemon,
see the Software Obsolescence section of [CLOCKSS: Threats and
Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Software_Obsolescence "wikilink")
and the Dependencies section of [LOCKSS: Software Development
Process](LOCKSS:_Software_Development_Process#Dependencies "wikilink").
This is a normal part of the LOCKSS team's development process. No
funding is needed to purchase new software. The risks involved are
described in the Software Obsolescence section of [CLOCKSS: Threats and
Mitigations](CLOCKSS:_Threats_and_Mitigations#Software_Obsolescence "wikilink").

The LOCKSS software is maintained by the LOCKSS team, funded jointly by
the CLOCKSS archive and the LOCKSS Alliance. The LOCKSS team has been
economically sustainable for more than 5 years solely on this basis
without grant funding.
