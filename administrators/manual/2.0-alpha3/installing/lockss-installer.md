title: Downloading the LOCKSS Installer
---

*This information applies to version 2.0-alpha3 of the LOCKSS system.*

You can download the LOCKSS Installer from GitHub using a [Git](git) command, as the `lockss` user:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lockss/lockss-installer
```

All the remaining instructions assume that the current working directory is 'lockss-installer';  cd to it now:

```bash
cd lockss-installer
```
