*This information applies to version 2.0-alpha3 of the LOCKSS system.*

The LOCKSS system is a distributed digital preservation software system developed by the [LOCKSS Program](https://www.lockss.org/) at [Stanford University Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/).

The 2.x series of the LOCKSS system stems from the LAAWS (LOCKSS Architected As Web Services) initiative, an ambitious modernization project that includes rewriting the classic LOCKSS daemon as a suite of containerized components. This version, LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3, is the third preview release on the road to LOCKSS 2.0.

This section of the manual is an introduction to LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3.
