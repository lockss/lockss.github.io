**This page is under construction. LOCKSS 2.0-alpha2 has not yet been released.**

*Last updated: 2020-02-04*

The LOCKSS Program is pleased to announce that **LOCKSS 2.0-alpha2**, the second publicly available prototype of its next-generation distributed digital preservation software suite, is now available for testing. *LOCKSS 2.0-alpha2 is a technology preview, not intended for production installations.*

## What's New?

*   Ability to use external PostgreSQL or Solr databases run locally or institutionally, rather than the included PostgreSQL and Solr databases.
*   Many performance improvements in the repository, including paginated iteration and artifact caching.
*   Upgraded the included Solr database from 6.6.5 to 7.2.1, and added tools to upgrade Solr across versions and schemas.
*   REST services authenticate, and REST clients and the Pywb web replay engine provide credentials.
*   Improved startup coordination and ready waiting of all components and databases.
*   Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements, and enhancements to the UI, installer, tests, documentation, and more.

## Installation

In order to install the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha2 system, you will need:

*   64-bit **Linux** host (physical or virtual) with at least 4 cores and 8 GB of memory
*   **Docker** running in Swarm mode and with the Local-Persist Docker volume plugin
*   **Git** to download the `lockss-installer` project from GitHub

For detailed installation instructions, see the [**Installing the LOCKSS System**](../manual/2.0-alpha2/installing) section in the [**LOCKSS System Manual**](../manual/2.0-alpha2).

## Upgrade

In order to upgrade a LOCKSS 2.0-alpha1 system to LOCKSS 2.0-alpha2, you no longer need the Pystache Python module, but *(temporarily for 2.0-alpha2 until we improve the process in 2.0-alpha3)* you will need to hava **Java 8** on the host machine (to run the Solr upgrade tool).

For detailed installation instructions, see the [**Upgrading From LOCKSS 2.0-alpha1**](../manual/2.0-alpha2/upgrading) section in the [**LOCKSS System Manual**](../manual/2.0-alpha2).
