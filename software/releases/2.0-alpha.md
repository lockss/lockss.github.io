## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I have questions or feedback after installing and testing the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha system?**

Please [contact us](#contact-us) for any questions, feedback or bug reports! Your contribution toward the final LOCKSS 2.0 release is very important to us and greatly appreciated by the community.

**I have an existing LOCKSS system (version 1.x). Can I upgrade to LOCKSS 2.0-alpha?**

The LOCKSS 2.0-alpha release is a technology preview which we are excited to share with the community for testing purposes, but it is not yet possible to convert from a classic LOCKSS system (version 1.74.7) to a LOCKSS 2.0 system.  To help us advance toward the final LOCKSS 2.0 release, please consider installing and running the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha release and providing feedback.

**Can I use my own Postgres database?**

The LOCKSS 2.0-alpha system runs its own Postgres database; the LOCKSS 2.0-beta system will allow you to use your own Postgres database instead if you choose.

**Can I use my own Solr database?**

The LOCKSS 2.0-alpha system comes with its own Solr database; in the LOCKSS 2.0-beta system, you will be able to choose to use your own Solr database if you prefer.

**Can I use the HDFS storage in my own Hadoop cluster?**

The LOCKSS 2.0-alpha system spins up its own HDFS storage. The LOCKSS 2.0-beta system will enable you to connect to your own HDFS storage over an unanthenticated HDFS port. If there is interest in connecting the LOCKSS system to HDFS storage over an HDFS port authenticated by Kerberos, the LOCKSS team will include it as part of its future development roadmap.
